I am a PhD student and pre-doc university assistant in the [Climate Dynamics and Modeling group](https://img.univie.ac.at/forschung/dynamik-und-modellierung-des-klimasystems) of Aiko Voigt at the University of Vienna. In my research I use climate models to investigate the climate dynamics of a Snowball Earth: a seperate state of the climate system in which the world is completely or almost completely covered in ice. 

I am also interested in interactive media, programming and storytelling.
